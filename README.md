# EE-442-Wireless-receivers

Lab 1: Adding noise, BPSK / QPSK mapping and demapping

Lab 2: Frame synchronization using a LFSR preamble generator and a correlator function

Lab 3: Pulse shaping, up-conversion and down-conversion

Lab 4: Time synchronization of received signal

Lab 5: Phase synchronization of received signal

Lab 6: Diversity receiver

Final project: We build an accoustic communication system based on OFDM, using all the steps completed in previous labs.
